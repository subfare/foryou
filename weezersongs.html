  <h2>01 - Da Vinci</h2>
  <p>Now this song is the first in the playlist for many reasons - I believe the song describes you perfectly and if I was an artist and wanted to preform any meaningful song to you that I had a lot of emotions for, this would be exactly that song.</p>

  <h2>02 - Precious Metal Girl</h2>
  <p>This song also just describes you perfectly and it’s so crazy how this song even exists cause it is literally you. When we both first listened to this song together which was when we went over the older playlist I made for you, I think we both instantly fell in love with this song and made this our song, and ever since it’s been in my most listened to songs and now also one of my favorite.</p>

  <h2>03 - Miss Sweeney</h2>
  <p>I’ll be honest and say that once I first discovered this song, I did not like it. After a few listens and trying to further understand the lyric and realizing how just amazing this song is, it is guaranteed in my top 10 if not top 5 favorite Weezer songs. This song I love so much and it’s grown on me so much from whenever I first listened to it to where I am now, I absolutely love it so much. You’ve now listened to the top 3 songs in the playlist which in my opinion is the most important ones but that doesn’t mean I did not put a lot of meaning and consideration into the rest of this playlist, I really did!</p>

  <h2>04 - Falling for You</h2>
  <p>My first thought is that this song reminds me of how I felt when we met, and then developing our relationship and progressingly getting older together, if that makes sense?</p>

  <h2>05 - Across The Sea</h2>
  <p>We both know the original meaning behind this song, but despite that I have decided to add it to this album because we can imagine a better meaning behind it, that being us. It’s unfortunate with long distance and that’s what this song could be about, but eventually it’ll be alright in the end - I also know you like this song and I feel like we both get connected well trough this song</p>

  <h2>06 - Hang On</h2>
  <p>In reality, this is a very good song but I do believe it has a slight negative aspect to it but in reality it’s issues we’ve been unfortunately dealing with and that is tough times in our relationship, I believe this song has a meaning of that regardless of what we struggle with as a couple etcetera, we always remember how much we love each other and how important our relationship actually is, this is at least how i view it and that is exactly why this song is so high up in the playlist.</p>

  <h2>07 - Odd Couple</h2>
  <p>This song is just literally about us I think - It’s about a couple that is very different, has different intrest, likes different things, how they act, stands out from the public and I genuinely see us in all of those. We could not relate more to this at least I think so and it just works out so well and this just reminds me of the two of us a lot.</p>

  <h2>08 - O Girlfriend</h2>
  <p>This is one of the songs in this playlist that does happen to have a sad story behind it, but a good outcome. This song reminds me of our struggles and the times we have been unfortunately close to breaking up, and then realizing how silly it usually is and how much I actually struggle to be without you. The melody for this song is also amazing and I love this song a lot!</p>

  <h2>09 - Only In Dreams</h2>
  <p>The reason this song is far up in the playlist is simply the storytelling that I think is very good here and how the song can be interpreted. The meaning of this song being in the playlist is because it reminds me of us being a long distance, now I think that explains the whole song itself if you view it from that interpretation.</p>

  <h2>10 - El Scorcho</h2>
  <p>This song is also amazing. My interpretation of this song is someone being in love with the other person. But the part that stuck out to me the most and hence one of the main reasons it is in this album is the sharing of intrest. The writer/rivers is introducing the person to his own interests, such as Green Day in this instance which is a thing we do a lot and it has changed both of us a lot as people, having introduced each other to a lot of new things which I believe is amazing and the meaning behind the song is also just very beautiful - Oh and also another thing about this song that I really  love is when we says “I can’t talk about it, I gotta sing about it” I just think that has a deep meaning to it</p>

  <div class="separator">_ _</div>

  <h2>11 - Girl We Got A Good Thing</h2>
  <p>This is just a wholesome song, almost motivating lol. I like the relaxing aspect of the song and I believe we can relate to a lot of this.</p>

  <h2>12 - Ruling Me</h2>
  <p>Now this song I have been a bit worried about, cause I cannot understand if the meaning of this song is just good or mainly good with some bad… It’s in this playlist after reseach on the spesific song and trying to understand it more properly and what I took from this song is positive but there is still some of the lyric that is throwing me of so if this has some bad meaning, it went above my head. I think this song is good cause rivers (me) sees the girl (you) as someone that’s almost more higher up then him, potentially a boss or something like that and describes her in ways that you only would describe someone how you think is beautiful and attractive to you.</p>

  <h2>13 - Fall Together</h2>
  <p>This is also another song from the maladroit album which is honestly one of my least favorite albums from weezer but these songs have made the album start growing on me. I don’t have to much to say about this song and it’ll probably continue being like that the further down the list we get but it reminds me of you a lot, along with every other song in this playlist!</p>

  <h2>14 - Keep Fishin’</h2>
  <p>This song is about someone strongly loving the other, this is also how I feel about you hence why it is an amazing addon to this playlist. It is also my favorite song from this album!</p>

  <h2>15 - Smile</h2>
  <p>This is a very catchy song and it has beautiful lyric. It reminds me of you a lot, but so does every song in this playlist</p>

  <h2>16 - December</h2>
  <p>This song is one of the most simple ones in this playlist, but it displays someone being in love very well and the feeling of being in love which I think is a beautiful thing and I share mutual feelings towards you, hence why this song is in the playlist - It is also a pretty catchy song.</p>
